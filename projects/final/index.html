                        <p>Friday; a music lover’s favorite day of the week.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <p>Every Friday, numerous artists drop new singles, EPs and albums for musicphiles to analyze and
                        add to
                        their
                        playlists. However, much to this demographic’s distaste, songs from their favorite artists have
                        become
                        shorter and shorter in recent years.
                    </p>
                    <p>“I feel like most songs are now less than 3 minutes when they used to be pushing 4 minutes,” said
                        sophomore
                        journalism and cinema and media studies student Lea Glaser.
                    </p>
                    <p>The average length of a song on Billboard’s 2023 Year-End Hot 100 was 3:13. In 1993, it was 4:19,
                        over a
                        minute longer.
                    </p>
                    <p>2023’s top songs like “Ella Baila Sola,” “Kill Bill,” “Unholy,” and “Barbie World” are all less
                        than
                        3
                        minutes long.
                    </p>
                    <p>“Cupid - Twin Version” , another popular song of 2023, is only 2:53. There is even a sped up
                        version
                        of the
                        song that shaves off another 28 seconds of the already short song.
                    </p>
                    <p>Radios used to play nearly 6 minute long songs like “Bohemian Rhapsody” by Queen and The Beatles
                        7
                        minute
                        long “Hey Jude.”

                        <p>The way in which music is consumed has affected its length.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <p>In the 1960’s popular song length hovered around 2:30. Most people listened to music via A.M.
                        radio. Hosts and producers preferred to play shorter songs on the radio so that if a listener
                        did not like the song, they would know it would be over soon and not skip.
                    </p>
                    <p>Also, shorter songs made less grooves on a record. This made the songs play on a record player
                        louder, making them better in the ears of the listener.
                    </p>
                    <p>The songs were also simpler, mostly following the verse, chorus, verse, bridge and final chorus
                        structure.
                    </p>
                    <p>In the 1970’s, ‘80’s and ‘90’s, songs steadily became longer. Vinyls became better in the ‘70’s,
                        allowing for more songs to be included on one record. The commercial release of CDs and CD
                        players in the early eighties allowed for even longer songs to be put on an album.
                    </p>
                    <p>The songs also became more complex. The intro and outros of songs were longer and artists began
                        to experiment more with bridges, pre choruses and other ‘optional’ sections of songs.
                    </p>
                    <p>Song length peaked in the 1990’s with an average length of 3:47 in the decade.

                <div class="col-md-5">
                    <p>From the early 2000’s onward, song length continued to decline. The popularity of music streaming
                        services began in 2005 and steadily increased over the years. </p>
                    <p>Sites like Apple Music and Spotify pay an artist royalties if a listener listens to at least 30
                        seconds of the song. Similarly to the 1960’s, this incentivises musicians to get to the hook or
                        chorus of their song quickly in order to keep the listener engaged.
                    </p>
                    <p>TikTok has also had a hand in the shortening of music. Since the app’s release in 2018, the way
                        listeners consume and judge music has significantly changed. Listeners want to be immediately
                        hooked by the song, causing artists to get to the chorus quicker and cut out any ‘boring’ parts
                        of the song.
                    </p>
